 The code has three steps, Initially the red led is turned on, the first step is to click on the first button, the next step is to turn the potentiometer all the way to the right, and the third step is to press the last button which turns the red led off and turns the yellow one on. The video demonstrated the same steps, and in the end i turned the potentiometer back to the left, which turns the yellow led off since it doesnt follow the sequence. The only issue i am facing right now is that the red led would not turn off in the end.
